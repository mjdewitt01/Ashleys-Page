			<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> Ashley Hart's Transfer Video <br> Experimental Video Edit, 1077Ã—606 <br> This video was inspired by someone who I see as my little sister. She had just got a scholarship
				to play basketball for SFSU and she was going to be transferring there the next semester. I decided to make a congratulatory video for someone who I was very proud of while showcasing some of her skills.
